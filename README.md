# ImageRecommendation

This repository contains the code for social image recommendation.


due to the expansion of the Internet and social networks, people are faced with a huge amount of dynamic information. Recommender systems have been emerged in order to improve the problem of the phenomenon of information abundance by analyzing the background of the user's behavior and extracting the user's interests and preferences. 

Our proposed method, consists of two main parts: feature extraction and deep reinforcement learning to learn the recommendation process. 
For feature extraction, we have three components: emotion analysis, personality recognition, and style detection.
